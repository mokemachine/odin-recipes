    <h3>COOMKIES</h3>
    <p>The "BaZoomZoom" sugar-free coomkies will radiate both waves
         of primordial bliss and counter-bowel frequencies in an epic display of
         digestive fireworks.<br> Designed to handle even the most rugged of trash belly bio-cosms,
        these coomkies are made with one-hundred percent "Goop-tech" technology that 
        <br> enables fasttracking, auto-aim, and DMV/CPA quality-of-life boost. Not many
        have been able to survive the tremors that these little wheat discs broadcast
        <br>to the systems of the body, but the proud few have left incredibly positive
        reviews. Check them out <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK-okdwv09g&list=FLkKK3_LrMdGy7Ls6isnF71Q&index=16">here</a></p>
    <h3>Reviews</h3>
    <p>"It rocked my shit", said one customer Shwayne Pengis. "I didn't
        expect a thing, and even if this little cookie<br> didn't mean nothing by it,
        damn thing tore my ass asunder soon as my stomach fully realized the
        extent of the threat."</p>

    <p>"Yeah it kinda fucked me up :P", said Heather Boofington, owner of 
        Mrrreow Cookies in the Shade District.<br> "I made this recipe as a
        limited-time release in my bakery and it almost flew as fast off the shelves
        as the shit that flew out of my customers."</p>

    <p>"Mmmm it was reallyyy goood m9, I really liked all the herbs and spoices"
